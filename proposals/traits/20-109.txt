Proposal for Fortran Standard: 202y (NOT 202x)

1. Problem

Currently, in order to pass a derived type to some library expected a type
derived from it's own abstract type requires the addition of a "wrapper"
type to be used. This requires a cumbersome amount of boiler plate code and
is not conducive to the type of "generic" code one would like to be able to
write.

This proposal seeks to address the issue that writing "generic" libraries
is either not possible, or places undue burden on its users. The main
benefits are the reduction in repeated logic or boiler plate wrapper types
required for generic libraries, thereby enabling more code reuse and easier
to maintain code bases.

2. Proposed Solution

The solution would require the addition of a few attributes and variable
declaration capabilities. First is the addition of the `trait` attribute to
a type specification. This requires that the type be abstract, and contain
no components. I.e.

    type, abstract, trait :: Show_t
    contains
      procedure(show_i), deferred :: show
    end type Show_t

    abstract interface
      function show_i(self) result(string)
        class(Show_t), intent(in) :: self
        character(len=:), allocatable :: string
      end function show_i
    end interface

Second is the addition of the `implements` attribute for a type
specification. The `implements` attribute requires a list of at least one
trait the type is to implement, requiring the type to contain the
procedures with the interfaces defined by the trait(s). I.e.

    type, implements(Show_t) :: Thing_t
      character(len=:), allocatable :: the_string
    contains
      procedure :: show
    end type Thing_t

    function show(self) result(string)
      class(Thing_t), intent(in) :: self
      character(len=:), allocatable :: string

      string = self%the_string
    end function show

Third is the addition of a variable declaration form using `trait`, in a
similar fashion to `class`. The `trait` specification would require a list
of at least one trait, and must either be allocatable, or a dummy argument
of a procedure. In a similar manner that the instantiated value of a class
variable must be of that type, or an extended type, the instantiated value
of a trait variable must be of a type which implements the given trait(s).
Thus, no components of the instantiated value are accessible, only the
procedures defined by the trait(s).

3. Backward compatibility

This addition to the language would not break any existing standard
conforming Fortran program, and thus preserves Fortran's backward
compatibility.
