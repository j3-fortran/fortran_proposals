# 1. Introduction

We propose adding a small set of features for an unsigned data to
Fortran 202y. Unsigned integers are a basic data type used in many
programming languages, such as C. They are useful for a range of
applications, including, but not limited to

- interfacing to C
- interfacing to the operating system
- random number generators
- image processing
- signal processing
- hashing
- cryptography (including multi-precision arithmetic)
- data compression
- binary file I/O

Unsigned integers were the fourth most requested item to add to Fortran
202x in 2017. It is the sixth item on the DIN national body list for
inclusion in Fortran 202y.

The use cases can be roughly divided into three classes:

- representing unsigned integer
- bit operations
- modular arithmetic (2^n for a datatype with n bits)

The two fundamental designs are:

- adding a dedicated type for each use case with the appropriate
  behavior of aritmetic operators and intrinsic functions on overflow;
  the different types can possibly just be different kinds for
  `unsigned(kind=...)`:
  * `unsigned`: arithmetic operation overflow do not wraparound, or are
    possibly not even defined
  * `bits`: bit operations are defined, arithmetic operations do not
    wraparound or are not defined
  * `modular`: arithmetic operations wraparound using modular 2^n
    arithmetic
- one `unsigned` type that is used for all three use cases; intrinsic
  functions are used to implement bit operations, various overflow modes
  (wraparound, checked, saturated), etc. One must choose some default
  behavior on arithmetic overflow, discussed below.

There is currently no community nor committee agreement which of the two
fundamnetal designs to do, nor what the default overflow behavior should
be for arithmetic operations if we go with the second design.

Consequently, we are proposing to implement the second design with
undefined behavior for arithmetic overflow, consistent with the existing
signed integers in Fortran, which allows processors to optionally check
for overflow. This proposal leaves the door open to later implement
either the first design, or the second design with defined overflow
behavior (to wraparound). It is also a subset of features that most
people seem to agree that we need.

The proposal adds a solution to all three use cases (data
representation, bit operations, modular arithmetic) that processors can
implement and users can start using. If later we decide to either add
dedicated types/kinds `bits` and `modular`, or define default arithmetic
operators' overflow to wraparound, no existing code will break.

## 1.1. Prior art

At least one Fortran compiler, Sun Fortran, supported unsigned integers.
Documentation can be found at [Oracle]
(https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19205-01/819-5263/aevnb/index.html).
This proposal borrows heavily from that prior art, without sticking
to it in all details.

## 1.2 Inputs to this proposal

In addition to the references listed above, the discussion at the
Fortran proposals site
https://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/issues/2
influenced this proposal.


# 2. Goal

Define a new type, UNSIGNED, with a small set of intrinsic operations
and intrinsic functions that would satisfy most of the use cases listed
above.

## 2.1 Value range limitation

An UNSIGNED with n bits has a value range between 0 and 2^n-1.
(Note that Fortran model integers have values between -2^(n-1)+1 and
2^(n-1)-1).

## 2.2 Arithmetic overflow is undefined

Just like the current (signed) integers, arithmetic overflow is
undefined. This allows processors to optionally check for overflow.

The following intrinsic binary arithmetic operators are extended
to support UNSIGNED values:
    +
    -
    *
    /

The unary - operator shall not be applied to UNSIGNED values.

The exponentiation operator ** shall not be applied to UNSIGNED values.


## 2.3 Prohibit mixed-mode arithmetic with INTEGER and REAL

The intrinsic Fortran binary arithmetic operators shall have both
operands be UNSIGNED if any of the operands is UNSIGNED.

The intrinsic Fortran binary relational operators (defined in R1014 rel-op)
shall have both operands be UNSIGNED if either of the operands is UNSIGNED.

To perform mixed-mode arithmetic with INTEGER or REAL values,
the UNSIGNED operand must be converted to an INTEGER or REAL
value explicitly via the INT or REAL intrinsic functions.


# 3. Avoiding traps and pitfalls

There are numerous well-known traps and pitfalls when using unsigned
integers. We attempt to avoid these as follows:
- comparison of signed vs. unsigned values: require conversion via
  an intrinsic function or other means.
- overflow from assignment of large UNSIGNED values to similar-sized
  INTEGER entities: Either accept truncation or specify the KIND with a
  larger range to the INT intrinsic function.
- confusion about modulo arithmetic, especially with respect to
  subtraction (e.g., 3u - 5u < 3u .EQV. .false.) is avoided
  because `3u - 5u` is undefined and compilers can optionally give a
  compile-time or runtime error.


# 4. Proposal

- A type name tentatively called UNSIGNED, with the same KIND
  mechanism as for INTEGER, plus a SELECTED_UNSIGNED_KIND function,
  is added to implement unsigned integers.

- Unsigned integer literal constants are marked with a U suffix,
  with an optional KIND specifier attached via the usual underscore.

- Add a conversion function UINT, with an optional KIND.

- Prohibit binary operations between INTEGER and UNSIGNED or
  REAL and UNSIGNED without explicit conversion.

- Permit unsigned integer values in a SELECT CASE.

- Prohibit unsigned integers as index variables in a DO statement
  or as array indices.

- Allow unsigned integers to be read or written in list-directed,
  namelist or unformatted I/O, and by using the usual edit
  descriptors such as I, B, O and Z.

- Allow UNSIGNED arguments to some intrinsics:
    - BGE(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED) and friends
    - BIT_SIZE(UNSIGNED)
    - BTEST(UNSIGNED, INTEGER)
    - DIGITS(UNSIGNED)
    - DSHIFTL(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED, INTEGER)
    - DSHIFTR(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED, INTEGER)
    - HUGE(UNSIGNED)
    - IAND(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED), IEOR, IOR, NOT
    - IBCLR(UNSIGNED, INTEGER), IBITS, IBSET
    - ISHFT(UNSIGNED, INTEGER, INTEGER) and ISHFTC
    - LEADZ(UNSIGNED) and TRAILZ
    - MERGE_BITS(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED
    - MIN(UNSIGNED, ...) and MAX
    - MOD(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED) and MODULO
    - MVBITS(UNSIGNED, INTEGER, INTEGER, UNSIGNED, INTEGER)
    - POPCNT(UNSIGNED) and POPPAR
    - RANGE(UNSIGNED)
    - SHIFTA(UNSIGNED, INTEGER), SHIFTL, SHIFTR
    - TRANSFER(UNSIGNED, UNSIGNED, INTEGER)

- Allow UNSIGNED arguments to some array intrinsics:
    - IALL(UNSIGNED array, INTEGER, [, mask]) and friends
    - IPARITY(UNSIGNED array, INTEGER [, mask])
    - CSHIFT(UNSIGNED array, INTEGER, INTEGER)
    - DOT_PRODUCT(UNSIGNED array, UNSIGNED array)
    - EOSHIFT(UNSIGNED array, INTEGER, INTEGER)
    - FINDLOC(UNSIGNED array, UNSIGNED, ...)
    - MATMUL(UNSIGNED array, UNSIGNED array)
    - MAXLOC(UNSIGNED array, ...), and MINLOC
    - MAXVAL(UNSIGNED array, ...), MINVAL

- Extend ISO_C_BINDING with KIND numbers, for example,
  C_UINT, C_UINT8_T.

- Extend ISO_C_BINDING with other things we forgot to do.

- Extend ISO_Fortran_binding.h appropriately.

- Extend ISO_FORTRAN_ENV with KIND PARAMETERs, for example,
  UINT8, UINT16, UINT32.

- Conversion of an UNSIGNED value to an INTEGER outside the range of
  the integer is processor-dependent.

- Conversion of an INTEGER value to an UNSIGNED outside the range of
  the integer is processor-dependent.

- Conversion of an UNSIGNED value to an INTEGER with a wider range
  is exact.

# 5. Relation to other proposals

This proposal is almost identical to J3/24-116 with the main difference
that overflow in arithmetic operators +, -, *, / is undefined instead of
wrapping around by default.

This proposal complements the BITS proposal, J3/07-007r2.pdf, as
proposed in J3/22-195.txt. BITS restricts its operations to logical
operations and comparisons on bit lengths. This proposal adds arithmetic
operations. This proposal limits the bit lengths to common powers of two.
