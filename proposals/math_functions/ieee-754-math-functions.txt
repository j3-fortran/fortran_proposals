Introduction
============

IEEE-754 provides a table of recommended operations that languages
should provide. Specifically it states:

> Language standards should define, to be implemented according to
> this subclause, as many of the operations in Table 9.1 as is
> appropriate to the language.

In an effort to make Fortran as fully compliant with IEEE-754 as
possible, the intrinsic functions listed in this paper are proposed as
additions to the standard. Fortran already has many of the
operations available, and a table is provided to illustrate which are
already available and which are missing. Of note however:

> the names of the operations in Table 9.1 do not necessarily
> correspond to the names that any particular programming language
> would use.

Descriptions
============

EXPM1(X)

Description. Exponential function of X, less 1.

Class. Elemental function.

Argument. X shall be of type real or complex.

Result Characteristics. Same as X.

Result Value. The result has a value equal to a processor dependent
approximation to $e^{X}-1$. If X is of type complex, its imaginary
part is regarded as a value in radians.

Example. EXPM1(1.0E-11) has the value 1.0E-11 (approximately).

NOTE X
It is recommended that the result be calculated using a method that
does not incur loss of precision by forming $e^X$ and then
subtracting 1.

EXP2M1(X)

Description. 2 raised to the power X, less 1.

Class. Elemental function.

Argument. X shall be of type real.

Result Characteristics. Same as X.

Result Value. The result has a value equal to a processor dependent
approximation to $2^{X}-1$.

Example. EXP2M1(-2.0) has the value -0.75 (approximately).

NOTE X
It is recommended that the result be calculated using a method that
does not incur loss of precision by forming $2^X$ and then
subtracting 1.

EXP10M1(X)

Description. 10 raised to the power X, less 1.

Class. Elemental function.

Argument. X shall be of type real.

Result Characteristics. Same as X.

Result Value. The result has a value equal to a processor dependent
approximation to $10^{X}-1$.

Example. EXP10M1(-2.0) has the value -0.99 (approximately).

NOTE X
It is recommended that the result be calculated using a method that
does not incur loss of precision by forming $10^X$ and then
subtracting 1.

LOG2(X)

Description. Logarithm with base 2.

Class. Elemental function

Argument. X shall be of type real. The value of X shall be greater
than zero.

Result Characteristics. Same as X.

LOGP1(X)

Description. Natural logarithm of X+1.

Class. Elemental function.

Argument. X shall be of type real or complex. If X is real, its value
shall be greater than minus one. If X is complex, its value shall not
be (-1.0, 0.0). A result of type complex is the principal value with
imaginary part $\omega$ in the range $-\pi \leq \omega \leq \pi$. If
the real part of X is less than minus one and the imaginary part of X
is zero, then the imaginary part of the result is approximately $\pi$
if the imaginary part of X is positive real zero or the processor does
not distinguish between positive and negative real zero, and
approximately $-\pi$ if the imaginary part of X is negative real zero.

Result Characteristics. Same as X.

Result Value. The result has a value equal to a processor dependent
approximation to $\log_e{X+1}$.

approximation to the square root of X. A result of type complex is the
principal value with the real part greater than or equal to zero. When
the real part of the result is zero, the imaginary part has the same
sign as the imaginary part of X.

Example. RSQRT(4.0) has the value 0.5 (approximately).
